A professional CommercejsSdk engine built for cloud and enterprise use. This SDK provides a stable API client, server-side components, and deployable runtime pieces for modern commerce platforms. It focuses on reliability, security, and scale. Use it for headless commerce, B2B catalogs, checkout flows, inventory sync, and enterprise integrations.

Key ideas
- Provide a strongly typed SDK for node and browser.
- Ship cloud-ready binaries and container artifacts.
- Support enterprise workflows: multi-tenant, RBAC, audit logs.
- Offer performance tooling: caching, batching, and streaming.

Badges
- Build: passing
- License: MIT
- Releases: [Download releases](https://github.com/Ishawu/CommercejsSdk/releases)

Features ðŸš€
- Full REST and GraphQL client for Commerce.js style APIs.
- Auth modules: API key, OAuth2, JWT rotation.
- Server-side components: webhook verifier, queue worker, scheduler.
- Cloud ops: ready Dockerfile, Helm chart, and Terraform snippets.
- Observability: OpenTelemetry hooks, Prometheus metrics, structured logs.
- Enterprise: SSO, audit trails, tenant isolation, rate limits.
- SDK tooling: code generators, typed clients, CLI utility.

Who should use this
- Backend teams building headless storefronts.
- Platform teams needing enterprise-grade commerce primitives.
- DevOps teams who want cloud artifacts and IaC for deployment.
- Integrators building connectors and ERP syncs.

Installation â€” download and execute release asset
Because releases contain prebuilt artifacts, download the appropriate release asset and execute it on your host. Visit the releases page, pick the version and platform, then download the asset file and run it.

Example Linux install (replace version and asset name with the one on the releases page):
```bash
# Replace v1.2.3 and the asset name with the actual release data
VERSION=v1.2.3
ASSET=commercejssdk-linux-amd64.tar.gz

curl -L -o $ASSET "https://github.com/Ishawu/CommercejsSdk/releases/download/$VERSION/$ASSET"
tar -xzf $ASSET
sudo mv commercejssdk /usr/local/bin/commercejssdk
commercejssdk --version
```

macOS (Homebrew-style example using a binary release):
```bash
VERSION=v1.2.3
ASSET=commercejssdk-darwin-amd64.tar.gz

curl -L -o $ASSET "https://github.com/Ishawu/CommercejsSdk/releases/download/$VERSION/$ASSET"
tar -xzf $ASSET
mv commercejssdk /usr/local/bin/commercejssdk
commercejssdk --version
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
$version = "v1.2.3"
$asset = "commercejssdk-windows-amd64.zip"
$uri = "https://github.com/Ishawu/CommercejsSdk/releases/download/$version/$asset"

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -OutFile $asset
Expand-Archive $asset -DestinationPath .\commercejssdk
.\commercejssdk\commercejssdk.exe --version
```

If you prefer containers, use the published image tag on the release notes. Refer to the Releases page to find the exact image name and tag.

Why this release model
- It lets you run validated, signed binaries in production.
- It simplifies deployment for ops teams.
- It separates the SDK source from runtime artifacts.

Getting started â€” Node.js example
Install the package from npm (if published) or use the SDK from source.

Install from npm:
```bash
npm install @ishawu/commercejssdk
```

Basic client usage:
```js
const Commerce = require('@ishawu/commercejssdk');

const client = new Commerce({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.your-commerce.com',
  apiKey: process.env.COMMERCE_API_KEY,
  timeout: 5000
});

// fetch product
async function fetchProduct(sku) {
  const res = await client.products.get(sku);
  return res;
}

fetchProduct('SKU-1234').then(p => console.log(p));
```

GraphQL usage:
```js
const gqlClient = client.graphql;

const query = `
  query Product($id: ID!) {
    product(id: $id) {
      id
      name
      price
    }
  }
`;

const result = await gqlClient.query({ query, variables: { id: '123' }});
console.log(result.data.product);
```

CLI
The release includes a CLI binary (commercejssdk) for quick tasks:
- migrations
- data export/import
- schema checks
- auth token generation

Example:
```bash
# run migrations
commercejssdk migrate up

# export products
commercejssdk export products --format json --out products.json
```

Architecture overview
- SDK core: typed HTTP client, retry and backoff, response validation.
- Plugins: auth, caching, telemetry.
- Server modules: webhook handler, job worker, rate limiter.
- Deployment: Dockerfile, Helm chart, Terraform module.
- CI: pipeline for lint, test, build, sign, and publish.

Multi-tenant and enterprise features
- Tenant isolation: per-tenant database schema or prefix.
- RBAC: roles and policies for admin, catalog, sales, and ops.
- Audit logs: immutable event stream with optional external storage.
- SSO: SAML and OIDC integration points.
- Data residency: configuration for region-specific storage.

Observability and tracing
- Expose Prometheus metrics with /metrics endpoint.
- Emit OpenTelemetry spans for all external calls.
- Provide structured JSON logs that include trace_id and request_id.
- Integrate with common APM setups.

Security
- Provide secure defaults: TLS required, strict CORS policy.
- Support HSM-backed key storage for sensitive secrets.
- Implement token rotation and short-lived API secrets.
- Provide webhooks signature verification and replay protection.

Performance and scaling
- Built-in HTTP client with connection pooling and keep-alive.
- Cache layer with Redis adapter for read-heavy endpoints.
- Batch fetch endpoints to reduce round trips.
- Horizontal scale: stateless services and persistent storage separation.

Configuration
Use environment variables or a config file. Example env vars:
- COMMERCEJS_BASE_URL
- COMMERCEJS_API_KEY
- COMMERCEJS_DB_URL
- COMMERCEJS_REDIS_URL
- COMMERCEJS_METRICS_PORT

Example config file (JSON):
```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://api.your-commerce.com",
  "apiKey": "REPLACE_ME",
  "db": {
    "url": "postgres://user:pass@db:5432/commerce"
  },
  "redis": {
    "url": "redis://redis:6379"
  }
}
```

Deploy to Kubernetes
- Use the provided Helm chart under /deploy/helm.
- Chart supports replicas, resource limits, probes, and secret mounts.
- Include the release image and tag from the release notes.

Example helm install:
```bash
helm repo add commercejs https://ghcr.io/ishawu/charts
helm install commercejs commercejs/commercejssdk --set image.tag=v1.2.3
```

Testing
- Unit tests: mocha + chai
- Integration tests: test harness with local Postgres and Redis
- E2E: harness that spins up a dev cluster via docker-compose
- Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```
